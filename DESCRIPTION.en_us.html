    Ysabeau combines the familiar timeless letterforms of the Garamond legacy with the unencumbered crispness of a clean low-contrast sans serif. Unlike other humanist sans, Ysabeau retains the confident wide stride and unapologetic extenders of the world's favorite book face for unmitigated reading comfort. Try it on your e-reader and never look back! Pair it with <i>EB Garamond</i> or <i>Cormorant</i> for a perfect match, or blow it up to page-filling sizes and revel in its elegance.

    Ysabeau offers extensive Latin, Greek and Cyrillic coverage with small caps, contextual and stylistic alternates, and classic Garamond-style ligatures. If you don't like ligatures, just disable them and let the contextual alternates take care of collisions instead!

	The spin-off fonts Ysabeau Office, Ysabeau Infant, and Ysabeau SC offer selected sets of OpenType variants promoted to default for ease of use:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Ysabeau Office</i> is an exercise in restraint. It suppresses the flamboyant long «Q» alternates, turns the slanted hyphen horizontal, and replaces the old-style figures with tabular lining figures.</li>
  <li><i>Ysabeau Infant</i> features single-storey designs for «a» and «g», a script-style «y», a tailed «l», Bulgarian Cyrillic forms, and proportional lining figures.</li>
  <li><i>Ysabeau SC</i> replaces the lowercase with small caps.</li>
</ul>
