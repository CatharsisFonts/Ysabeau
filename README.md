# The Eau de Garamond Typeface Project

Eau de Garamond is a free display type family developed by Christian Thalmann ([Catharsis Fonts][1]).  It is open source, and all its working files (in [Glyphs][2] format) are available from this repository. If you wish to work with Eau de Garamond in a different font editor (which I wouldn't recommend), I can provide you with UFO versions of those files instead.

Any feedback, bug reports, test results, and suggestions for additions are very welcome. You can contact me using the [Eau de Garamond issue tracker][4]. 

If you like Eau de Garamond, please help spread the word via the social media of your choice. You might also be interested in my other typefaces on [MyFonts][1] and in my other free type family [Cormorant][3]

### Installation

If you wish to use the Eau de Garamond type family on your computer, simply download the "EauDeGaramond_Install" ZIP file from the [latest release][5], unpack it, and install the TrueType font files (.ttf) as appropriate for your operating system.

If you wish to use the Eau de Garamond type family on your website, you will be able to obtain it from the [Google Fonts][12] service once it is finished.

### License
 
The Eau de Garamond typeface and all its associated font files are free software under the [SIL Open Font License][10]. Essentially, this gives you the right to download, use, and redistribute the fonts as you like, provided that 

1. you retain my copyright notices;
2. you do not redistribute this software without this license information; and 
3. you do not redistribute the fonts by themselves for a fee (though you are allowed to sell them as part of a bundle containing other items.)

### Acknowledgements
 
Eau de Garamond has been conceived, drawn, spaced, kerned, programmed, interpolated, and produced in its entirety by myself (Christian Thalmann, [Catharsis Fonts][1]). I did all the work with [Glyphs][2], which I consider the world's best font editing software. It's not free, but it's worth every penny ten times over; I cannot recommend it enough. I used the public beta version of the RMX Harmonizer plug-in to ensure curve quality.
 
While this project was heavily inspired by [Claude Garamont][6]'s immortal legacy, I did not use any specific font as a starting point or direct reference for my designs. Most glyphs were drawn from scratch, using the source files for my previous Garamond-flavored typeface [Cormorant][3] as a starting point to save time on defining kerning classes and OpenType coding. When I needed guidance regarding the Garamond solution on a specific character, I usually looked at the free typeface [«EB Garamond» by Georg Duffner][13].
 
I am very grateful to the creative souls on the [TypeDrawers][7] forum, the [Typografie.info][11] forum, and the (late?) [Typophile][8] forum for teaching me all I know about type design in the first place, and for providing me with a large amount of excellent feedback on Eau de Garamond. This goes in particular for Jasper de Waard and Pablo Impallari, who were particularly generous with their help. Likewise, my gratitude goes to the tireless folks at [Glyphs][2] — in particular Rainer Erich Scheichelbauer (Mekka Blue, [Schriftlabor][9]) and Georg Seifert — for the creation and support of their magnificent engine.
