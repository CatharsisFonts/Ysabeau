FONTLOG for the Ysabeau font family


This file provides detailed information on the Ysabeau Font Software (formerly known as Eau de Garamond). This information should be distributed along with the Ysabeau fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Ysabeau is a Unicode sans-serif typeface aiming to encompass the Adobe Latin 4 range of characters as well as the Cyrillic script.  It is inspired by Claude Garamont's timeless designs.  A series of weights spanning from Hairline to Bold are going to be offered, and true Italics are foreseen for all weights.  The ChangeLog below indicates the degree of completion of the current build.

Ysabeau combines the robustness of a low-contrast sans with the time-honored legible shapes of the Garamond typefaces, allowing it to perform equally well at large sizes and for running text at reasonable sizes. Note that since the adherence to the Garamond flavor and its generous proportions is the main design goal, this typeface is not optimized for small font sizes or low-resolution screens.

ChangeLog

2019-01-06:
Changed typeface name to Ysabeau (the given name of Claude Garamond's second wife).
Romans and Italics are now complete in the Hairline and Bold masters. Work on an additional Black master is progressing, with the core Latin set already in workable condition in the Romans.
(Christian Thalmann)

First version of the Roman cut in 2.5 masters (Hairline, Bold, intermediate layer where necessary) including small caps completed. No Cyrillic or Italics yet.
